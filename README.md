# Pokémon Gold: Space World 1997 Story Mode Patch

This is a work-in-progress build of making the Pokémon Gold prototype demoed at Space World 1997 into what could have been the final (or at least unfinished) version of Generation 2 that we could have received in an alternate timeline.

At the very bottom of this README, you will find the original README provided on the PRET disassembly repository that this was initially forked from. Below you will also find the currently planned changes/features/fixes, stretch goal plans, and the necessary tools for building or contributing to this project.

## CONTRIBUTIONS EXTREMELY WELCOMED!
Please feel free to help with this as much as you want. I am doing this solo as of the time of writing this README and do not have a ton of experience working with ROMs at this level. Any and all help is immensely appreciated!

## Necessary Tools
- RGBDS: [**rgbds github**] and/or [**rgbds Install**]
- Programming Application Suggestions: [**Sublime Text Editor**] or [**Visual Studio Code**] (If you use VSCode, try out this syntax highlighter. It isn't perfect but it is still helpful. Please let me know if there is a better option that you recommend instead. [**VSCode Assembly Syntax Highlight**])
- A copy of Gold_debug.sgb renamed **baserom.gb** to build the ROMs (you will need to provide yourself)

# Pokémon Gold and Silver: Space World 1997 Demo [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a work-in-progress disassembly of the Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver prototypes demoed at Space World 1997.

It builds the following ROMs:

- Gold_debug.sgb `sha1: b1d7539a87dea81b2cff6146afaad64470d08d84`
- Gold_debug.sgb (correct header) `sha1: 87fd8dbe5db39619529abcfc99e74cc5ecb8b94e`

You will need to provide a copy of Gold_debug.sgb renamed **baserom.gb** to build the ROMs.
